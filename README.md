# ASxxxx Cross Assembler and Linker

This is a Language Extension for [Visual Studio Code][vsc]. It adds syntax highlighting for the [ASxxxx Cross Assember and Linker][asxxxx].

ASxxxx is a great toolchain just open-sourced in March 2021 by [Alan R. Baldwin][arb].

## Supported Assemblers

ASxxxx is a collection of assemblers for varying architectures. I'll be adding support for all assemblers included. This is a list of all currently supported architectures (assemblers):

* 1802 (as1802)

## Known Bugs/Problems

* Strings can be delimited with and printing character; but this extension will only highlight strings delimited by double-qoutes (`"`). See [page 1-21 of the manual][asxxxxman].

## Contributions

Contributions are highly encouraged and welcomed! If you find something amiss or a bug, please [submit an issue][iss] and I'll do my best to fix it.
